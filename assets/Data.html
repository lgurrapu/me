      In recent years, I have focused on leadership in Cloud, DevOps, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).
      I’ve led cloud adoption strategies, designed scalable architectures, and optimized CI/CD pipelines to enable
      seamless deployments and operational efficiency across AWS, Azure, and GCP. My work has emphasized reducing
      manual toil, improving observability, and enhancing system reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a passionate technologist, I thrive on fostering collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement.
      My expertise includes infrastructure as code (Terraform), observability (Splunk, Dynatrace), and
      containerization (Kubernetes, Docker), driving modernization and cost optimization across enterprises.
